# Explanation: Transaction Banking Flow

This document explains the `transaction Banking.mmd` diagram.

## Purpose
This diagram shows the end-to-end process of corporate transaction banking including payment initiation, especially in bulk payment.

This is a detailed, step-by-step analysis of the end-to-end process flow for bulk payments on AFFINMAX platform in Malaysia, as depicted in the provided flowchart. The workflow is logically divided into four distinct phases, ensuring security, accuracy, and proper authorization before final settlement.

Phase 1: Client Initiation (The Maker)

This initial phase is handled by a corporate user known as the 'Maker'. The Maker's primary responsibility is to prepare and initiate the payment instruction.

A: Start: Corporate 'Maker' logs into AFFINMAX Portal
The process begins when a designated user from the client's company, the 'Maker', securely logs into the AFFINMAX online banking portal. This is the entry point for all subsequent actions.

(Arrow A -> B)
Upon successful login, the Maker initiates the bulk payment process by navigating through the portal's menu.

B: Navigates to Cash Management > Bulk Payment
The Maker selects the 'Cash Management' module and then chooses the 'Bulk Payment' option. This action takes them to the specific interface for handling payments to multiple recipients simultaneously.

(Arrow B -> C)
The next step is to provide the payment details to the system.

C: Uploads a pre-formatted payment file (e.g., .txt or .csv with payee details, amounts)
Instead of entering each payment manually, the Maker uploads a single file that contains all the necessary payment information. This file must be in a pre-formatted structure (like a text file or a CSV file) and includes details for each transaction, such as the recipient's name, account number, and the amount to be paid. This method is efficient for handling a large number of payments.

(Arrow C -> D)
Once the file is uploaded, the system takes over to perform an initial check.

D: System performs initial file validation (format, syntax check)
The AFFINMAX system automatically validates the uploaded file. This is a critical check to ensure the file's integrity and compatibility with the bank's processing system. The validation includes:

Format Check: Verifying if the file is in the correct format (e.g., .txt, .csv).

Syntax Check: Ensuring the data within the file is structured correctly, with no missing fields or incorrect data types (e.g., letters in an amount field).

This node represents a conditional logic point.

(Arrow D -- Invalid File --> E)
If the system detects any errors in the file's format or syntax, it follows the 'Invalid File' path.

E: Error is flagged; Maker corrects and re-uploads
The system flags the file as invalid and provides the Maker with an error report detailing what needs to be corrected. The Maker must then fix the issues in the payment file offline and re-upload it.

(Arrow E -> C)
This arrow shows the process looping back. After correcting the file, the Maker uploads it again, and the system performs the validation check once more. This loop continues until a valid file is submitted.

(Arrow D -- Valid File --> F)
If the file passes the initial validation, the process moves forward.

F: Maker reviews summary and submits for approval
The system presents a summary of the payment file to the Maker. This summary typically includes the total number of transactions and the total payment amount. This gives the Maker a final opportunity to review the batch and ensure its accuracy before sending it for internal authorization. The Maker then clicks 'submit'.

(Arrow F -> G)
Upon submission by the Maker, the transaction's status is officially updated.

G: Transaction status: Pending Approval
The bulk payment instruction is now logged in the system with a status of 'Pending Approval'. It is parked in a virtual queue, waiting for the next level of internal corporate control—the Authorizer.

Phase 2: Internal Corporate Approval (The Authorizer)

This phase introduces a crucial security principle: the separation of duties. A different user, the 'Authorizer', must review and approve the payment instruction created by the Maker.

(Arrow G -> H)
The workflow now requires action from another user.

H: Corporate 'Authorizer' logs into AFFINMAX
A second corporate user with authorization privileges logs into the AFFINMAX portal. This person cannot be the same individual as the Maker.

(Arrow H -> I)
Once logged in, the Authorizer needs to find the payment batch awaiting their review.

I: Authorizer accesses the 'Pending Tasks' queue
The Authorizer navigates to their task list or dashboard, often labeled 'Pending Tasks' or 'Approval Queue', which displays all transactions waiting for their action.

(Arrow I -> J)
From the list of pending tasks, the Authorizer selects the specific bulk payment file.

J: Selects the transaction for review
The Authorizer clicks on the specific bulk payment transaction initiated by the Maker to view its details.

(Arrow J -> K)
The Authorizer now performs their verification.

K: Authorizer verifies transaction details (total amount, number of transactions)
The Authorizer carefully reviews the details of the bulk payment, cross-referencing the total amount and the number of individual payments with their internal records (e.g., invoices, payroll summary). This step serves as a manual check to prevent errors or fraudulent payments.

(Arrow K -> L)
After reviewing the details, the Authorizer must make a decision.

L: Authorization Decision
This is the second major conditional logic point in the workflow, where the Authorizer must either approve or reject the payment batch.

(Arrow L -- Reject --> M)
If the Authorizer finds a discrepancy or does not approve the payment for any reason, they choose the 'Reject' path.

M: Transaction is rejected with reasons (Flow stops, Maker is notified)
The Authorizer rejects the transaction and must provide a reason for the rejection. This reason is recorded and communicated back to the Maker. The process for this specific payment batch stops here. The Maker would need to initiate a new, corrected transaction from the beginning.

(Arrow L -- Approve --> N)
If the Authorizer confirms that the payment details are correct, they choose the 'Approve' path.

N: Authorizer provides final approval using 2-Factor Authentication (2FA)
To ensure high security, the approval is not a simple click. The Authorizer must provide a second form of verification, known as 2-Factor Authentication (2FA). This is typically a one-time password (OTP) sent to their registered mobile device or generated by a security token.

(Arrow N -> O)
This final act of approval by the client triggers the handover to the bank.

O: Transaction status: Submitted to Bank
Upon successful 2FA verification, the status of the transaction changes to 'Submitted to Bank'. The corporate side of the workflow is now complete, and the instruction is securely transmitted to Affin Bank's internal systems for processing.

Phase 3: Bank-Side Processing & Settlement

Once the client has fully authorized the payment, Affin Bank's backend systems take over to execute the transaction.

(Arrow O -> P)
The bank's systems receive the client's instruction.

P: AFFINMAX backend system receives the authorized instruction
The bank's core processing system for AFFINMAX receives the digital instruction for the bulk payment. This is an automated hand-off.

(Arrow P -> Q)
Before moving any funds, the system performs automated security and compliance checks.

Q: System performs fraud scoring and sanctions screening
This is a critical risk management step. The system automatically screens all transactions in the batch against:

Sanctions Lists: Checking payees against national and international lists of sanctioned individuals and entities to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) regulations.

Fraud Scoring: The transaction is analyzed by an automated engine that looks for unusual patterns or red flags that might indicate fraud.

(Arrow Q -> R)
After clearing the security checks, the system checks for fund availability.

R: Funds availability check on the corporate account
The system checks if the corporate client's source account has sufficient funds to cover the total amount of the bulk payment. This is the third conditional logic point.

(Arrow R -- Insufficient Funds --> S)
If the account balance is less than the required total payment amount, the 'Insufficient Funds' path is taken.

S: Transaction Failed (Notification sent to corporate users)
The transaction is immediately failed. An automated notification is sent to the designated corporate users (both Maker and Authorizer) informing them of the failure and the reason (insufficient funds). The process for this batch ends here until the client's account is funded and the payment is re-initiated.

(Arrow R -- Funds Available --> T)
If the funds are sufficient, the process continues to the debiting stage.

T: Corporate account is debited
The total amount of the bulk payment is debited from the client's corporate account. The funds are now secured by the bank for onward payment.

(Arrow T -> U)
The system now determines how to send the funds to the various recipients.

U: Payment routing to appropriate channel based on payment type
This node represents a routing decision. The AFFINMAX system intelligently sorts the individual payments within the batch and routes them to the correct clearing channel based on the payee's details and the payment type.

(Arrow U -- Statutory (EPF, SOCSO, LHDN) --> V)
For payments to Malaysian statutory bodies like the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), Social Security Organization (SOCSO), or the Inland Revenue Board (LHDN), a specific path is taken.

V: Formatted file transmitted to respective statutory bodies
The system packages the statutory payment details into a specific file format required by each body and transmits it directly to them through a secure, established channel.

(Arrow U -- Interbank/Local Payments --> W)
For regular payments to other bank accounts within Malaysia, a different path is used.

W: Transaction sent to PayNet Gateway
These payments are routed to PayNet, Malaysia's national payments network and central infrastructure.

(Arrow W -> X)
PayNet processes the transaction using one of several methods.

X: Processed via IBG (Interbank GIRO) or DuitNow Transfer
Depending on the payment details (e.g., account number vs. DuitNow ID), PayNet processes the payment.

IBG (Interbank GIRO): A standard electronic fund transfer system for payments between different banks in Malaysia.

DuitNow Transfer: An instant credit transfer service that allows payments using a recipient's mobile number, NRIC, or business registration number.

Phase 4: Confirmation and Reporting

The final phase involves confirming the successful processing of the payments and providing the necessary reporting to the client for their records.

(Arrows V -> Y and X -> Y)
After the respective clearing channels have processed the payments, they send back confirmation signals.

Y: Confirmation received from statutory bodies / PayNet
The AFFINMAX system receives electronic confirmation messages from both the statutory bodies and the PayNet gateway, indicating that the payments have been successfully processed and sent to the recipient banks.

(Arrow Y -> Z)
This confirmation triggers a final status update in the client-facing portal.

Z: Transaction status updated in AFFINMAX: Processed
The status of the bulk payment transaction in the AFFINMAX portal is updated to 'Processed'. This informs the corporate users that the payment has been executed successfully.

(Arrow Z -> AA)
To provide documentary evidence, the system generates official records.

AA: Debit and Credit advices are generated
The system automatically generates:

Debit Advice: A formal notification for the corporate client confirming that their account has been debited.

Credit Advice: A notification for the recipient (though often sent via their own bank) that a payment has been credited to their account. These advices can be downloaded from the portal.

(Arrow AA -> BB)
The final step is to ensure the transaction is reflected in the client's financial statements for accounting purposes.

BB: Transaction details are reflected in online account statements for reconciliation
The debit from the bulk payment appears as a line item on the client's electronic bank statement, available through the AFFINMAX portal. This allows the client's finance department to easily reconcile their internal records with their bank account activity.

(Arrows M -> END, S -> END, BB -> END)
These arrows indicate the termination points of the workflow. The process ends if:

The transaction is rejected by the Authorizer (M).

The transaction fails due to insufficient funds (S).

The transaction is successfully processed and reported (BB).

This is a detailed, step-by-step analysis of the end-to-end process flow for bulk payments on Affin Bank's AFFINMAX platform in Malaysia, as depicted in the provided flowchart. The workflow is logically divided into four distinct phases, ensuring security, accuracy, and proper authorization before final settlement.

这是一份**Affin Bank AFFINMAX 平台上的“Bulk Payment”（批量付款）流程图解读与逐步分析**的解释。该流程被系统性地划分为四个阶段，确保付款的**安全性、准确性和审批合规性**，直到最终结算完成。

---

## 🔹**第一阶段：客户发起付款（Maker角色）**

**Maker** 是企业客户指定的操作员，负责准备和发起付款流程。

### 步骤解析：

1. **A: 登录 AFFINMAX**

   * 企业用户（Maker）通过网上银行门户登录，开始批量付款流程。

2. **B: 进入菜单 Cash Management > Bulk Payment**

   * 用户点击进入批量付款界面，准备进行大批量的转账。

3. **C: 上传预设格式的付款文件（如 .txt 或 .csv）**

   * 文件包括每个收款人的姓名、账号和金额。适用于工资发放、供应商付款等场景。

4. **D: 系统初步验证（文件格式 + 语法检查）**

   * 检查文件是否正确（如字段是否缺失、格式是否符合规范等）。

   * **如果失败 → E：**

     * 系统提示错误，Maker 修正文件后重新上传（返回步骤 C）。

   * **如果成功 → F：**

     * 显示付款摘要（总金额、总笔数），Maker 检查后点击提交。

5. **G: 状态更新为 Pending Approval（待授权）**

   * 进入第二阶段，由另一个角色进行审批。

---

## 🔹**第二阶段：公司内部授权（Authorizer角色）**

此阶段体现了**职责分离原则**，由另一位公司用户进行审批。

### 步骤解析：

1. **H: Authorizer 登录 AFFINMAX**

   * 这位用户**不能是 Maker 本人**，具有审批权限。

2. **I: 进入“待处理任务”队列**

   * 查看所有等待其审批的交易。

3. **J: 选中目标批量付款任务**

4. **K: 审核付款详情**

   * 对照发票、工资表等确认金额和笔数。

5. **L: 作出授权决定**

   * **如果拒绝 → M：**

     * 必须填写拒绝原因，系统通知 Maker。交易终止。
   * **如果批准 → N：**

     * 使用\*\*双重认证（2FA）\*\*确认授权。

6. **O: 状态更新为 Submitted to Bank（提交至银行）**

   * 银行系统接管处理流程。

---

## 🔹**第三阶段：银行处理与结算**

由 Affin Bank 的后台系统执行转账操作。

### 步骤解析：

1. **P: 银行后台接收到付款指令**

2. **Q: 系统进行风控检查**

   * 包括：

     * **制裁名单筛查（Sanctions Screening）**
     * **欺诈评分（Fraud Scoring）**

3. **R: 检查企业账户是否有足够资金**

   * **如果余额不足 → S：**

     * 交易失败并通知客户。终止。
   * **余额充足 → T：**

     * 从客户账户扣款。

4. **U: 判断付款类型并路由到合适通道**

   * **若为法定付款（EPF, SOCSO, LHDN）→ V：**

     * 转成特定格式并传送至法定机构。
   * **若为一般付款 → W：**

     * 通过 PayNet（国家支付网关）处理。

5. **X: 由 PayNet 使用 IBG 或 DuitNow 进行转账**

   * IBG：标准银行间转账（非即时）
   * DuitNow：实时转账，可用手机号或注册号作为识别方式

---

## 🔹**第四阶段：确认与报表**

确认交易成功并提供记录。

### 步骤解析：

1. **Y: 接收确认信息**

   * 来自法定机构或 PayNet 的成功处理回执。

2. **Z: 状态更新为 Processed（已处理）**

   * 显示交易成功。

3. **AA: 生成借记/贷记凭证（Debit/Credit Advice）**

   * 可供客户下载，用于财务核算或作为付款证明。

4. **BB: 明细显示在网银账户对账单**

   * 方便财务团队进行对账和审计。

---

## 🔚**三种可能的流程结束点**

1. **M：被 Authorizer 拒绝**（交易中止）
2. **S：资金不足导致失败**（交易中止）
3. **BB：成功执行并反映在账单上**（交易完成）

---

## ✅ 总结

整个流程强调：

* **职责分离**：Maker 和 Authorizer 必须为不同人
* **合规控制**：多重验证、制裁筛查、2FA
* **效率提升**：批量上传、自动报表、即时确认
* **风险防范**：语法/格式检查、欺诈评分、余额判断

此流程在保障资金安全与合规性的同时，也提升了企业付款的效率和可追溯性。需要特别注意三处关键逻辑判断点（Validation、Authorization、Funds Availability），任何一个失败都会中止该批付款流程。
